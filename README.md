# QueenBAI2
 
QueenBAI2 is an AI for screeps (www.screeps.com) based around the concept of a network of Bee Hives.  The 0th iteration of this software was a very rough version that needed to have the whole code base copy and pasted for every spawn.  It was easily defeated, as the destruction of a single spawn would bring it all down.  

From this the 1st iteration was made, QueenBAI, with the concept that every spawn was a "Queen" and each base was a hive.  This was much more effective in that every room was self sufficient and the addition of a new room/spawn would simply be able to spin up on its own without new code.  The problem here is that it had no greater sense of the whole empire- a single Queen would grow herself, defend herself, etc, but would never defend or supply her sisters.

QueenBAI2 was built around the concept of an Empress above all queens.
